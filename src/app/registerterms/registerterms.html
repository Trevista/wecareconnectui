    <p>
      JLMUSH mission	is	to	help	billions	of	people	live	healthier	and	longer	lives.	In	pursuit	of
      this	mission,	our	aim	is	to	offer	an	exceptional	experience	to	both	users	(users	refer	to
      patients	 in	 the	 document	 as	 per JLMUSH Terms & Conditions (1)(0u) and	 healthcare
      practitioners.	 As	 a	 valuable	 partner	 on	 our	 platform	 we	 want	 to	 ensure	 that	 the
      practitioners’	experience	on	the	JLMUSH booking	platform	is	seamless	to	both,	them	and
      their	users.
    </p>
    <b> Guidelines</b>

    <p>
      To	enable	you	to	deliver	a	great	experience	to	patients	booking	appointments	with	you
      via	JLMUSH website/app,	we	request	all	practitioners	to	follow	the	below:
    </p>
    <ol typr="1">
      <li>
        Ensure	that	the	patient	consults	the	same	practitioner	with	whom the	appointment
        has	been	confirmed	within	2	hrs	of	the	scheduled	appointment	time.	If	due	to
        practitioner’s	unavailability	this	is	not	possible,	then	the	appointment	should	be
        cancelled	or	rescheduled	to	another	time	beforehand
      </li>
      <li>
        . Communicate	to	the	patient	about	any	expected	delay/cancellation	at	least	2	hours
        prior	to	the	scheduled	time	of	appointment*
      </li>
      <li>
        Update	the	practitioner’s	JLMUSH Profile	and	calendar	in	following	cases:
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
          <li>
            Any	scheduled	closure*	of	the	clinic/hospital,	e.g.	on	festivals;	and,	blocking
            calendar*	on	personal	holidays
          </li>

          <li> Transfer	of	resident/consulting	practitioners	to	another	establishment*</li>
          <li>Change	in	practitioner	or	clinic/hospital’s	consultation	timings*</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      *The	features	to	perform	these	are	available	on	JLMUSH	PULSE	 ,	JLMUSH Profile	and
      VCPT by	JLMUSH	.	For	details	on	these,	please	feel	free	to	reach	out	to	us	at
      support@JLMUSH.com	or	+91	9440052680
    </p>

    <b>Exceptions to the Guidelines</b>

    <p>
      We	completely	understand	and	respect	the	complexity	of	the	medical	profession,	and
      therefore	consider	following	exceptions(where	a	healthcare	practitioner	was	unable	to
      follow	the	above	guidelines):
    </p>
    <ol>

      <li>
        In	case	of	personal	or	medical	emergencies,	we	understand	that	doctor
        substitution,	doctor	no-show,	last	minute	cancellation/rescheduling	is	unavoidable.
        In	such	instances,	on	discretion,	a	one-time	exception	for	non-compliance	will	be
        made.
      </li>
      <li>
        In	case	the	patient	is	consulted	by	another	practitioner	followed	by	the	one	with
        whom	the	appointment	was	booked,	then	it	is	not	considered	as	non-compliance.
      </li>
      <li> In	case	patient’s	wait	time exceeds	2	hours,	non-compliance	is	assigned	on	a	caseby-case	basis.</li>
      <li>
        In	case	the	practitioner	doesn’t	practice	anymore	at	the	clinic,	where	appointment
        has	been	booked,	the	clinic	owner/doctor	must	update	the	information.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <b>Non-compliance to the Guidelines</b>
    <p>
      Non-compliance	cases	are	kept	in	record	as	and	when	reported	to	JLMUSH via	users.	All
      such	cases	are	verified	by	our	team	with	both,	the	practitioner	and	the	user.	Each
      inbound	and	verified	non-compliance	case	received	by	JLMUSH,	will	be	communicated
      to	the	practitioner	(clinic/hospital	and	doctor)	in	following	ways	-
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Email	and	SMS	at	the	doctor	and	practice	registered	email	ID	and	mobile	number.</li>
      <li>
        Book	Standards	dashboard	for	all	practices	and	doctors	on	Book	facility. Learn how
        to use Book Standards Dashboard.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Non-compliance	cases	lead	to	poor	patient	experience	and	may	have	a	negative	impact
      on	the	reputation	of	the	practice,	therefore	JLMUSH may	in	such	instances	deactivate
      the	‘Book’	facility	from	JLMUSH profile	for	allowing	the	practitioner	to	become	wellversed	with	the	guidelines	and	become	comfortable	with	using	the	features	associated
      with	it.	However,	while	the	Book	facility	is	deactivated,	the	patients	would	still	be	able
      to	connect	with	the	practitioner	or	clinic/hospital	through	the	‘Call’	facility.
      The	deactivation	of	Book	will	be	based	on	the	number	of	verified	non-compliance	cases
      in	the	current	quarter	i.e.	90	days	period	(starting	on	 1	April,	1	July,	1	Oct	,	1	Jan	every

    </ol>
    <p>

    <h2>3uB.Patient No-Show Policy (PNS)</h2>

    <p>
      Patients	not	showing	up	for	doctor	appointments	is	a	widespread	phenomenon	in	India.
      This	can	have	dire	consequences,	especially	due	to	the	dearth	of	medical	practitioners	to
      address	the	health	concerns	of	a	growing	population.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our	 Patient	 No-Show	 policy	 has	 been	 put	 in	 place	 to	 ensure	 timely	 healthcare	 for
      everyone	using	the	JLMUSH platform.	In	the	JLMUSH context,	Patient	No-Show	means	a
      patient	 hasn’t	 turned	 up	on	 time	 for	an	appointment	 booked	 through	JLMUSH.com	 or
      JLMUSH App	 without	 cancelling,	 rescheduling,	 or	 informing	 the	 practice/doctor	 in
      advance	about	the	same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capturing patient-no-show from doctors/ clinics
      When	a	patient	doesn’t	show	up	for	a	confirmed	appointment	(without	having	cancelled
      or	 rescheduled	 before	 appointment	 time),	 doctors	 using	 JLMUSH	 pulse	 can	 mark	 the
      specific	appointment	as	PNS	on	their	desktop	JLMUSH	Pulse or	the	JLMUSH	pro/JLMUSH
      app.
    </p>
    <p>
      PNS	can	be	marked	only	within	5	days	following	the	scheduled	appointment.
      Verifying PNS from patients
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever	a	doctor/clinic	marks	PNS,	patients	are	sent	an	SMS	and	email	to	verify	this
      claim	and	understand	the	reason	behind	the	missed	appointment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Patients	should	respond	in	next	7	days	after	receiving	the	SMS/email,	with	the	reason.

    <p>
      Every	 PNS captured	 on	 JLMUSH is dealt	 with	 seriousness	 based	 on	 past	 patient
      behaviour.	 This	 is	 done	 in	 order	 to	 ensure	 patients	 understand	 the	 importance	 of	 a
      doctor’s	time	and	not	misuse	the	convenience	provided	by	JLMUSH.	Our	PNS Policy	aims
      at	minimising	instances	of	uninformed	missed	appointments,	thereby	making	most	of	a
